## Reason for updated release
* Internal refactoring and some additional user facing functionality.

## Downstream dependencies
This causes a test to fail in the downstream i2extras package.
I am the maintainer of that package and have a patch release ready to submit once this has been accepted on to CRAN.

## Test environments
* local Fedora 34, R Under development (unstable) (2021-06-27 r80567)

## R CMD check results
Status: OK
