**Disclaimer:** this package is a work in progress, in constant development. 
Please reach out to the authors before using.

*incidence2* refocusses the scope of the original
[incidence](https://github.com/reconhub/incidence) package.  The aim is to
provide a "tidy" interface for users to work with whilst at the same time
simplifying the underlying implementation.  

Whilst we are in the early stages of development, we aim to re-implement
the "fitting" functions of [incidence](https://github.com/reconhub/incidence)
(e.g. `incidence::fit`) in a smaller, separate, package with a more consistent 
interface, more choice of underlying models, and tidier outputs. To this end,
the package scope of *incidence2* focusses only on the initial data handling,
calculation and graphing of incidence objects.


## Installing the package

To install the development, *github* version of the package use:
